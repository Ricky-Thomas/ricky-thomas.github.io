<p>I grew up in Caledonia, which is a small farm town about 20 minutes outside of Rochester, New York. After high school I went to SUNY Brockport and received a Bachelor's degree in Theatre and Music. Shortly after I moved to New York City in pursuit of my dreams and my next big step towards independence! Well the independence part turned out all well and good... The acting/singing has been somewhat of a challenge. Just the cost of living in NYC has kept me working non-stop at all sorts of jobs. Most of them being in the restaurant industry, though I did have a week long stint as a hand model! True story! I would spend 50+ hours some weeks at dead end jobs just to pay the rent, and in the little free time I had, I would not want to spend it preparing for auditions or emailing casting directors. So okay, it was time to reevaluate. I wanted to do something with my life that I enjoyed, and also that would give me a chance to have a normal life one day! You know... family, dog, picket fence, the whole shebang.</p>

<p>So what is it I enjoy? My entire life I've had three big passions:</p>
<h3>The Performing Arts</h3>

<p>Ever since I can remember I've been participating in theatre groups around the community. I love to sing and will do so often.</p>

<h3>The Environment</h3>

<p>Growing up surrounded by fields and forest on all sides with an Environmental Police Officer for a father and an Elementary Science Program Developer for a mother... let's just say I know my foliage. I love our planet and firmly believe that if I can do anything during my time here to help preserve it, it would be an enormous victory for me.</p>


<h3>Technology</h3>

<p>I'm always fascinated by the inner workings and various applications of the new technology that the millennial generation has grown up alongside. Every time a new gadget comes out, I want to read about it. Lately, I love spending my free time sitting in front of the PS4 slaying mad dragons.</p>

<p>Coding had always been something I was hesitant to delve into, however I've found that there truly is potential here for me to do something with my life that I hold a true passion for. Of course there are other things I'm passionate about too! Honorable Mentions: Snowboarding, Cooking, Reading, Soccer, Running, and my cat (though if she knew she only made honorable mention there would be hell to pay so mum's the word!)</p>
